# DSCI498
This repo contains code and materials for a project which aims to detect potential adverse events in healthcare time-series data using deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. 
Publicly available real-world datasets and synthetic datasets to simulate trial-like conditions will be used.

Objectives:
Implement AE detection for adverse event monitoring.
Explore deep learning methods to improve early detection
